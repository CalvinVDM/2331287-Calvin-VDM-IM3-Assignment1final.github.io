		<h2>Week 7 - Dev Blog </h2>

				The IxD Process for the development of my website:
              
            </p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				Goal:
				My goal was to create a website based on a theme and service and to structure the website to look professional, interactable, and appealing to people.
				
            </p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				Information Structure:
				In terms of structure, I have a nav bar at the top of the page and a footer that pops up when one reaches the bottom of the page. This gives the user a sense of how far they are scrolling and when the pages end.  The homage is split into sections using the background to differentiate between them; each has its content. The website is loosely based on a service helpline that people can contact to help themselves if they struggle with mental illnesses. The blog page is divided into sections using cards for intractability. The essay page is empty, and the portfolio page has a bunch of drawings I did in my time I still need to add more context and substance to that page like my own profile etc. 
				
            </p>

            <p class = "blog1_text">
				User flow:
				The user enters the website on the homepage, and they can scroll down to see what the website is about there will be images and descriptions to give the website substance. At the top, there is a nav bar for the user to go to the other pages such as the blog page, design page etc. the blog page will enter the user into a page with multiple cards that show which blog post they can enter and go to. The design and portfolio page will have an image scroller where the user can cycle through images such as wireframes in the design section and a series of drawings, I have made on the portfolio page.
				
            </p>

            <p class = "blog1_text">
				Interface:
				This website includes cards that light up when they are hovered on, an input system to take user information as well as a nav bar for interaction.
				
            </p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				Design:
				I went all out in the use of Java as well as CSS to give the website a natural feel that looked very aesthetically pleasing to the eye as well as elevating the user experience throughout the website. I used many calming elements such as clouds and light colours to give an overall easy Cloud 9 feel to the website.
				
            </p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				In terms of my decision making, I decided to make s theme for my website so that I have a clearer and more stable goal to work towards also the theme makes it easier to base the rest of my website’s looks feel and overall look. I decided on the theme of mental health because I thought it would suit my current attitude and feelings as I’ve been trying harder to take care of myself in terms of my mental state and feelings.
            </p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				Reading:
				I enjoyed this week’s reading as it helped me think about my UX as my website caters heavily for making people feel comfortable and feel at ease. I liked how they talked about the user experience and make a connection to the aesthetics, practicality and feel of the UI that affects the user’s experience. I like how they talk about the user experience as dynamic and hard to pinpoint because it is a testament to the grand scale of UX and how it affects one’s website creation. I like the connection of grabbing the user’s attention while simultaneously making something aesthetically pleasing and practical.
