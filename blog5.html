                Hanli was sick for these two weeks, so we didn’t have any classes, but I worked on defining my website better and tried to incorporate the Java work we did for those weeks.
                
            </p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
                The first thing I did was look at my theme and page aesthetics in terms of how my design and fonts looked as well as any images and videos. I struggled to find a balance between the use of a professional type design and a free and artistic type design, so I opted for something in the middle and made the UI feel very technical and professional while making the UX feel more artistic free and comforting.
            </p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
                The IxD process helped me define my goals and theme and in terms of my design, it helped me flesh out the current website I have. There are still a few things I would like to do on the technical side such as using more JavaScript in terms of making events and more things to interact with. An example is making a system where one can get generated quotes or encouraging messages to help boost the interactivity of my website. There is also a problem with things loading sometimes the pages glitch out and look weird when scrolling but I have been working on fixing that and making it look better.
            </p>

            <p class = "blog1_text">
                Other than that I put some thought towards my internet art and what I would like it to be thinking this websites theme is to raise awareness of one’s mental health so maybe something like showing steps and indicators for one’s mental health could make a good artwork by making a timeline sort of thing whereas ones scrolls more is revealed or I could make a world map that shows where the countries with the most mental health related cases are but for know that just speculation and I haven’t made anything of substance yet.
            </p>

            <p class = "blog1_text">
                Lastly, I wanted to get feedback on my UX and some of my classmates liked the look and feel of my website so far, I am happy with the way its looks and can’t wait to progress from here.
            </p>
